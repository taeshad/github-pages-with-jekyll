# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I am a recent graduate and retired student- athlete. I studied Mass Communications- Public Relations at Campbell University.

I played softball at the collegiate level my first two years at Tallahassee Community College where I received the accolades of All- Panhandle Conference, All- State, All- Region, All- American as well as TCC Female Student Athlete of the Year, Academic All Panhandle Conference, and Academic All- American. While at Tallahassee Community College I also was a member of the Student Athlete Advisory Committee.

I have excellent work ethic, with an outgoing personality. I will not shy away from a difficult situation, nor will I be satisfied until a job is done correctly.
